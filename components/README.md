# v8/components
v8 components using the Template Pattern. Enables v8 to build it self via v8/components/build which offers compile and debug.
Also incremental adopts parts of v8 and chromium and turns them into components that do run on v8. So we port from the libc
runtime to the v8 shell/runtime/builder/compiler
